Each module does a specific job, but they must work together. The interfaces between them are just as critical as the algorithms inside the modules.
Any large software system is much easier to understand and implement if the designer takes care with the fundamental abstractions and interfaces.
For a compiler, it&amp;rsquo;s better to break it to many pieces (modules).</description></item><item><title>How I Made ChatGPT Run on My Terminal without an API key?</title><link>https://ahmedhosssam.github.io/posts/chatbang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:42:42 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://ahmedhosssam.github.io/posts/chatbang/</guid><description>I had a problem where I wanted to stop leaving the terminal and going to ChatGPT back and forth just for a quick question.

So it&amp;rsquo;s better to take the L and move on and try other things I wanted to try, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t because of competitive programming. For the rest of the article I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the sunk cost fallacy.
Alright, I want to talk about my experience with competitive programming and why it was a bad experience, I also want to generalize the topic to a little bit to make it relevent for most people even if your problems in life has nothing to do with CP.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://ahmedhosssam.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ahmedhosssam.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi, Iâ€™m Ahmed Hossam, a programmer, computer science student, chess fan, and aspiring engineer.
