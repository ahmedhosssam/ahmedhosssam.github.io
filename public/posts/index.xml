          TLDR # I tried competitive programming for a whole year and it didn&amp;rsquo;t work out well for me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it and didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve anything remarkable as well. So it&amp;rsquo;s better to take the L and move on and try other things that I wanted to try, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t because of competitive programming. For the rest of the article I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the sunk cost fallacy.
